====== Devil's Ritual ======
Created Thursday 07 March 2019

A Bone Devil: Marrithrax and
A Chain Devil: Obsian  chants an abyssal ritual using its chains to bind a young boy levitating in the air.
  Each turn the chains bind slightly tighter and blood trickles from the boy, seeping into the stone floor of the chamber.
  The party could surprise the two devils as they are busy with their ritual.
  The boy dies on Obsian's 3rd turn.
